\subsection{Supply filter}

The purpose of the supply filter is to filter out noise from the power supply and buffer voltage peaks.
A simple embodiment of a supply filter is that of an RC low-pass filter as illustrated in \Cref{fig:filter_lowpass}.
\begin{figure}[H]

	\begin{circuitikz}
		\draw (0, 0) node[ocirc, label=$V_\text{in}$]{} to[resistor, label=$R$] ++(4, 0) node(node)[circ]{};
		\draw (node) -- ++(2, 0) node[ocirc, label=$V_\text{out}$]{};
		\draw (node) to[capacitor, label=$C$] ++(0, -2) node[ground]{};
	\end{circuitikz}
	\caption{Passive low-pass filter using an RC circuit.}\label{fig:filter_lowpass}
\end{figure}
In \Cref{fig:filter_lowpass} the input voltage is connected through a resistor $R$ with the output voltage.
After the resistor $R$, a capacitor $C$ is connected with ground.
The transfer function of the RC low-pass filter can be obtained from the voltage divider with complex impedances,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}}
	=\frac{Z_C}{Z_R+Z_C}
	=\frac{1}{1+j\omega RC}.
	\label{eq:transfer_filter_rc}
\end{equation}
The absolute value of the transfer function,
\begin{equation}
	\abs{\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}}}
	=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(f/f_{RC}\right)^2}},
\end{equation}
has a pole at frequency,
\begin{equation}
	f_{RC}=\frac{1}{2\pi RC}.
\end{equation}
% TODO: explain how to select R and C values for low-pass
The frequency response of an RC low-pass with pole frequency $f_{RC}=\SI{100}{\hertz}$ is visualized in \Cref{fig:bode_filter_rc}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\begin{semilogxaxis}[xmin=1, xmax=1e6, xlabel=Frequency (Hz), ymin=-100, ymax=10, ylabel=Gain (dB), ytick={0, -20, -40, -60, -80}, grid=minor]
			\addplot[domain=1:1e9]{-10*log10(1+(x/100)^2)};
		\end{semilogxaxis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Bode plot of the frequency response of an RC low-pass at \SI{100}{\hertz}.}\label{fig:bode_filter_rc}
\end{figure}
We can see how the frequency response suppresses frequency above \SI{100}{\hertz}.
However, efficient frequency suppression starts at \SI{-80}{\decibel} which the given RC low-pass of \Cref{fig:bode_filter_rc} only satisfies for much higher frequencies than the pole frequency.

% TODO: give example of two pole filter and how to choose parameters
One approach to improve the frequency response of a filter is to introduce additional frequency poles.
In the limit of infinite many frequency poles, one is able to approach an ideal brick-wall filter.
The frequency response of an ideal brick-wall filter resembles a step function.
In practice, one finds good enough results for two pole filters.

% TODO: give example of capacitance multiplier and how to choose parameters
In addition to a multi-pole filter, a capacitance multiplier can be used to increase the effective capacitance of a filter.
The capacitance multiplier is described in Ref.~\cite[p.~536]{Hobbs11} and Ref.~\cite[p.~578]{Horowitz15}.
