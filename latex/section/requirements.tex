\section{Requirements}

% TODO: precision and accuracy
% TODO: motivate bandwidth 1 kHz

The device should be powered by a dual voltage supply of \SI{15}{\volt} using a 4 pin LEMO connector.
The components on the printed circuit board should be assembled using surface-mount technology.
The device including casing should have a width below \SI{8}{\centi\meter} and a height below \SI{20}{\centi\meter}, preferably smaller, such that it can be integrated easily into existing optical setups.
The optical detector should be located as close to the bottom of the device as possible, as it allows greater height compatibility.

The spatial resolution of the center of mass of the incident light should be about \SI{1}{\micro\meter}.
Offset errors are tolerable as long as precision is high.
We aim for a signal bandwidth of \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}.
The radiant flux of the incident light should be in the microwatt range.
