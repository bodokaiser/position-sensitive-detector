\section{Schematic}

The present section discusses some critical sections of the electrical schematics and should read for reference if parameters need to be adjusted.

\subsection{Photodiode frontend}

The design of the operational amplifier circuits is critical for the performance of the detector.
In the following section, we give a very brief summary of the design and the chosen parameters, which should be sufficient for someone familiar with operational amplifiers.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Voltage regulator}

We use two voltage regulators to maintain a constant voltage of \SI{\pm12}{\volt} from the external \SI{\pm15}{\volt} power supply. The \SI{\pm12}{\volt} voltage powers most components except the transimpedance amplifiers of the detector.
Using a dedicated pair of voltage regulators to power the transimpedance amplifiers decreases the load on the primary voltage regulator.

\Cref{fig:voltage_regulator_dual} shows the circuitry of the primary voltage regulators that output \SI{\pm12}{\volt}.

\subsection{Voltage reference}
