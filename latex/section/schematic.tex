\section{Schematic}

The present section discusses the critical sections of the electrical schematics and should be consulted for reference if parameters, for example, bandwidth or gain, need to be adjusted.

\subsection{Photodiode frontend}

The photodiode frontend is responsible for converting the photocurrent to a voltage.
The most simple frontend, a resistor, has limited bandwidth.
Using a transimpedance amplifier, we can decouple the output voltage from the voltage swing across the diode.
The bandwidth is now limited by the amplifier gain.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:transimpedance_amplifier} shows a transimpedance amplifier frontend circuit representing the photodiode by a current source with capacitance.
The current source relates to the power of the incident light by
\begin{equation}
I_\text{in} = S(\lambda) P,
\end{equation}
wherein $S(\lambda)$ is the spectral responsivity, also known as photosensitivity, and $P$ is the power of the light beam.
The photodiode's datasheet specifies the capacitance $C_\text{in}$.

The operational amplifier's output voltage in the transimpedance configuration is equal to
\begin{equation}
	V_\text{out} = - R_f I_\text{in}.
\end{equation}

A feedback capacitance
\begin{equation}
	C_f\geq\sqrt{\frac{C_\text{in}}{2\pi R_f f_u}},
	\label{eq:feedback_capacitance}
\end{equation}
wherein $f_u$ is the \gls{gbp} of the operational amplifier,
 is sufficient for stability.
 In general, the input capacitance of the operational amplifier adds to the input capacitance.
 In practice, solder joints and \gls{pcb} traces may add to the capacitance such that a slightly higher value than given by \eqref{eq:feedback_capacitance} is recommended.
 However, if the feedback capacitance is too high, we remove high-frequency components of our signal, which might be of interest.

\subsection{Voltage regulator}

We use two voltage regulators to maintain a constant voltage of \SI{\pm12}{\volt} from the external \SI{\pm15}{\volt} power supply. The \SI{\pm12}{\volt} voltage powers most components except the transimpedance amplifiers of the detector.
Using a dedicated pair of voltage regulators to power the transimpedance amplifiers decreases the load on the primary voltage regulator.

\Cref{fig:voltage_regulator} shows the circuitry of the primary voltage regulators that output \SI{\pm12}{\volt}.
The positive voltage regulator U1 of type LM317 and the negative voltage regulator U2 of type LM337 have an internal reference voltage of \SI{1.25}{\volt}.
