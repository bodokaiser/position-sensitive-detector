\section{Schematic}

The present section discusses some critical sections of the electrical schematics and should read for reference if parameters need to be adjusted.

\subsection{Photodiode frontend}

The design of the operational amplifier circuits is critical for the performance of the detector.
In the following section, we give a very brief summary of the design and the chosen parameters, which should be sufficient for someone familiar with operational amplifiers.
